In order to run this hip new beat, download and open Sonic Pi. Then 
copy and paste the code in sonicPiFile in a buffer tab (Buffer 0 should be great). 
Then run that code! (Click the run button in the top left corner in Sonic Pi).

In this project I learn how to use Sonic Pi to create some fun sound scapes using different 
loops, lists, and sound types. 

Also you can play the audio file Sonic Pi Project 2 in an audio player.
